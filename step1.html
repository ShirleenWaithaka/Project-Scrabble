      <p>
        Scrabble is a classic word game where players score points by forming
        words from individual letter tiles on a game board.<br />Each letter
        tile has a point value, and players arrange these tiles on a 15x15 grid
        to create words, much like a crossword puzzle.<br />The goal is to score
        the most points by creating high-scoring words, often by taking
        advantage of bonus squares on the board (like double or triple
        letter/word scores). <br />The game combines vocabulary, strategy, and
        sometimes luck with the letter tiles drawn.

        <p class="p">HOW TO PLAY</p>
        <h3>Board layuot</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
            Center star: The center star is where the first word of the game
            must be placed. .
          </li>
          <li>
            TW (Triple Word): When a word covers a square marked "TW," the total
            score of the word is tripled. If you place a word that covers more
            than one TW square, the score is multiplied by 9 (3x3).
          </li>
          <li>
            DW (Double Word): If a word covers a "DW" square, the total score of
            the word is doubled. If a word lands on two DW squares, the score is
            multiplied by 4 (2x2).
          </li>
          <li>
            DL (Double Letter): When a letter is placed on a "DL" square, the
            value of that letter is doubled. Only the individual letter score is
            doubled, not the entire word.
          </li>
          <li>
            TL (Triple Letter): If a letter lands on a "TL" square, the value of
            that letter is tripled. Again, only the letter score is tripled, not
            the entire word.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <div id="row" class=""></div>
    </section>
    <div>
      <h3>STEP 1</h3>
      <p>
        Have each player pick one tile out of the tile bag. <br>
         The player that gets the letter closest to the letter “A” goes first. <br />
        Each player then draws seven tiles from the tile bag. <br> 
        Player One begins the game by placing a word on the star square at the
        centre of the board. <br />They can start either horizontally or vertically. <br>
         This star acts as a double-word score.
      </p>
      <iframe src="step2.html" class="iframe" title="Scrabble Step 2"></iframe>

      <h3>STEP 2</h3>
      <p>
        Tally each word score by adding point values for each letter in the word
        point <br> Values range from 0 point for a blank tile to 10 points for the letters.
        <br />
        Have a paper and a pen to keep track of the word scores for each
        player. <br> Some squares on the board allow you to multiply the tiles value by
        two or three.
      </p>

      <h3>STEP 3</h3>


      <p>
        Continue playing in a counterclockwise direction around the board. <br>
        During each turn, a player can decide to place a word on the board, exchange tiles,or pass. 
        <br />
        If a player decides to exchange tiles, replace them with an equivalent number from the tile bag. <br>
         If they choose this option, they cannot do anything else on that turn.
      </p>

      <iframe src="step3.html" class="iframe" title="Scrabble Step 3"></iframe>
 

      <h3>STEP 4</h3>
      <p>
        After placing a word on the board, draw an equal number of new tiles
        from the tile bag so that each player always has seven tiles.
      </p>

      <h3>STEP 5</h3>

      <p>
        All letters played must touch at least one letter that
        is already on the board to form at least one complete word. <br />
        When one player has used all of their tiles or no one can make any more
        words, the game ends. If a player uses all seven of their tiles in one
        turn, <br />
        they add a 50-point bonus to their word score.
      </p>

      <h3>STEP 6</h3>

      <p>
        Consult a dictionary only if you’re challenging another player’s word. <br>
        If the word isn’t in the dictioanary, the player loses their turn. <br>
        If the word is allowed, the challenger loses their turn.
      </p>
      <h3>STEP 7</h3>

      <p>
        Calculate each player’s final score by adding up the points from all of
        their word scores. <br />
        Then, subtract the sum of their unplayed letters. <br> If one player has used
        up all of their letters, add the sum of everyone else’s unplayed letters to their score. <br>
         The player with the highest score wins.
